# Research
Research into existing products will be completed below.

## [Hivemind](http://www.Hivemind.co.nz)
The site doesn't actually say the cost, however its previous [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hivemind/innovative-wireless-beehive-scales), suggests a price per hive of around $500. Pretty expensive. Additionally, this is only for laptop dongle and connection.
The product is not just a scale, but entire system. Including:
- Salltelite hub
- Hive weight scales
- Raingauge
- Water level
- GPS locator
- Hive strength monitor

Which I assume is marketed as a system, and as expandable. A product ecosystem, like apple if you will.
Hives are weighed with a 160g resolution. Scales are set to a 300kg limit, and have a 1 year battery life. The scales are designed to fit 8-10 frame langstroth hives. Physically the scales are at the front and back. The scales report hive weight every 6 hours to the receiver.

The communication hub sends data 2-4 times per day, plus any alarms, via sattelite. It is IP68 rated, and has no battery life reported. The batteries in all units are standard AA1.5v Lithium batteries (expensive). Likely due to the discharge curve, and life time as well as reliability of lithium batteries. However lithium non-rechargeable batteries are much more expensive. These are batteries such as the CR2032 package, which has a long shelf life time, though small capacity.

non-electronic, Needs to be done in person. Takes time, calibration. Etc.

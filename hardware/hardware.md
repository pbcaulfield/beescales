##CPU

###[Arduino Nano](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardNano)
COST:$3.00/unit
Although retired, there are plenty of sites which provide this product. It can be powered by battery, and configured to use extremely low power. It should also have adequate memory (32k-2k) for the task at hand, provided libraries can be reduced in size. This uses the ATMEGA328 CPU and has a variety of analog and digital outputs.

##Connectivity

###ESP8266

###nRF24L01+ Module

#Alternatives Considered
###[JeeNode](http://jeelabs.net/projects/hardware/wiki/JeeNode)
Looking around led me to look at the [JeeNode](http://jeelabs.net/projects/hardware/wiki/JeeNode). A package which already has some communication hardware on board, and was developed to run low power from the start. However buying these individually was at best $22.85 AUD when buying in bulk (10 or more). And this didn't include some other parts, so would represent perhaps a $10-15 increase in total cost per unit.
